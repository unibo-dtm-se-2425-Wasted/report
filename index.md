## Abstract

Food waste is one of the most pressing challenges in modern societies. It not only represents a significant economic loss for households and businesses but also has far-reaching environmental and ethical consequences. The project Wasted was conceived as a practical software solution to raise awareness of food waste at the domestic level and to empower users to manage their household inventories more efficiently. The application combines database management, user authentication, data visualization, and external API integration within a streamlined web interface built with Streamlit. Its main objective is to provide an accessible platform that helps individuals monitor food purchases, track expiration dates, and receive suggestions on how to reuse ingredients before they spoil. This extended abstract presents the motivation, design, implementation, and evaluation of the project.

The main goals of the system are to:
Allow users to register and log in securely.
Enable them to record food items with details such as purchase date, expiration date, quantity, and cost.
Provide clear indicators of each itemâ€™s status (OK, Expiring Soon, or Expired).
Estimate the financial loss associated with expired products.
Offer recipe suggestions for items that are about to expire.
