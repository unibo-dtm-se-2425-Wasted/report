# Release

The project is not distributed as a Python package on PyPI, because our primary goal is to provide users with a ready-to-use web application.

- End users are not expected to install or import the code via `pip`.  
- Instead, the application is deployed directly on Streamlit Cloud, where it can be accessed through a web browser without any installation or setup.  
- This approach simplifies the user experience: users only need to visit the appâ€™s URL, rather than downloading and configuring Python packages locally.  

In short, the focus is on ease of access and usability rather than package distribution.
  

# Release process
- The source code is hosted on GitHub.  
- Whenever a push is made to the `main` branch (or the branch connected to Streamlit Cloud), the application is automatically redeployed.  
- No manual build or upload procedure is required, unlike a traditional Python package release.  

# Versioning
- Semantic Versioning (SemVer) on PyPI is not used.  
- Version tracking can be achieved through:  
  - the commit history on GitHub, or  
  - manually created GitHub tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`).  

# Release artefacts
- The main artefact is the deployed Streamlit interactive application, accessible via the public URL generated by Streamlit Cloud.  
- No `.whl` or `.tar.gz` distribution files are produced, since the package is not published to PyPI.
