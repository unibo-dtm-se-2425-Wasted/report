# CI/CD

## Conceptual description

The project exploits a **Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)** workflow based on **GitHub Actions**.  
The purpose of the workflow is to ensure that the system remains stable and correct at every commit, by automatically executing the defined test suite.  

### Scope of Automation
---
**Continuous Integration (CI):**  
  - Every push and pull request on the main branch automatically triggers the workflow.  
  - The workflow installs dependencies and runs all unit tests.  
  - If tests fail, the workflow is marked as failed and contributors are notified by email.  

**Continuous Delivery (CD):**  
  - At this stage, no deployment automation is implemented.  
  - However, the project is structured so that adding a deployment step (e.g., building a Docker image or deploying to a hosting service) would be straightforward.

The rationale for this automation is to ensure that new contributions do not compromise existing functionality, while also enforcing a baseline of code quality by requiring that all tests pass before merging. It further provides developers with immediate feedback through GitHubâ€™s notifications and status checks, which shortens response times and promotes safer, more efficient collaboration.

### Implementation Details
GitHub Actions uses a YAML configuration file (placed in `.github/workflows/`) that specifies:  
  - The **trigger** (push, pull request).  
  - The **environment** (Python version).  
  - The **jobs** (install dependencies, run tests).  
Tests are executed in a clean virtual environment provided by GitHub runners.  

## Current status

- The CI workflow is active and working: contributors receive email notifications when the workflow completes.  
- The workflow ensures that all code merged into the repository passes the test suite, thus increasing the reliability of the system.
