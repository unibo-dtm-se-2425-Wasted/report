# CI/CD

The CI/CD pipeline for the Food Waste Manager application is designed to streamline the integration, testing, and deployment of both the backend, developed in Python, and the frontend, built using Streamlit. By automating key stages of the development process—such as environment setup, dependency management, testing, and deployment—the pipeline minimizes manual intervention and reduces the risk of errors reaching production. This ensures that potential issues are detected early, improving overall code reliability. Moreover, the automated workflow allows new features, bug fixes, and updates to be delivered quickly, keeping the application in a continuously deployable state. Overall, the pipeline enhances the maintainability, scalability, and performance of the Food Waste Manager, ensuring it can meet current requirements while remaining adaptable for future growth.

**Why CI/CD for Food Waste Manager?**
Implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline for Food Waste Manager brings several key benefits tailored to the application’s needs:
- Consistent Code Quality: Automated testing ensures that every change to the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend meets strict quality standards. This prevents errors from being deployed and maintains a stable experience for end-users.
- Faster Feature Delivery: By automating integration, testing, and deployment, the CI/CD pipeline reduces delays in rolling out new features and bug fixes. Updates can reach users quickly, shortening the time-to-market.
- Scalability: As the application grows in features or user base, the pipeline is capable of handling increasing complexity. It provides a scalable framework for larger codebases and more extensive testing requirements.
- Improved Developer Productivity: Automation reduces repetitive manual tasks, allowing the development team to focus on enhancing core functionalities. This improves efficiency and lowers development costs. 

**CI/CD Workflow for Food Waste Manager**
Backend CI/CD Process
The CI/CD pipeline for the backend automates testing and deployment to ensure consistent quality and reliability. The key steps include:
- Python Environment Setup

The pipeline configures Python 3.11 to maintain compatibility with FastAPI.

A virtual environment isolates dependencies to prevent conflicts.
```bash
- name: Setup Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: '3.11'
```
- Dependency Management

Dependencies are installed using pip based on requirements.txt, ensuring consistent environments.
```bash
- name: Install Dependencies
  run: pip install -r requirements.txt
Automated Testing
```

- Unit tests validate core application logic, database operations, and edge cases using unittest or pytest.
```bash
- name: Run Tests
  run: python -m unittest discover -s tests
Build and Deployment
```

After tests pass, the backend is packaged and deployed automatically to a target environment (e.g., Streamlit Cloud).

- Secrets, such as API keys, are securely referenced in the workflow.
```bash
- name: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
  env:
    STREAMLIT_CLOUD_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.STREAMLIT_CLOUD_TOKEN }}
  run: streamlit run app.py
```
**Frontend (Streamlit) CI/CD Process**
The CI/CD pipeline for the frontend ensures that all changes are tested and deployed seamlessly:

- Environment Setup
- Configures Python and Streamlit for the frontend application.
- Dependency Installation
- Installs required Python packages via requirements.txt.
- Automated Testing
- Validates UI components, input handling, and API interactions.
- Build Process
- Prepares the frontend for deployment (e.g., bundles static files).
- Deployment
- Deploys the frontend to a hosting platform like Streamlit Cloud.

**GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration**
GitHub Actions orchestrates the entire CI/CD process, automating each stage for every commit or pull request to the main branch. Key steps include:
- Code Checkout: Retrieves the latest repository state.
- Environment Setup: Configures Python for backend and frontend.
- Dependency Installation: Installs all necessary packages.
- Automated Testing: Runs unit tests to ensure code quality.
- Build and Deployment: Deploys the application only if tests pass, maintaining a reliable production state.

**Benefits of the CI/CD Pipeline**
By implementing this CI/CD pipeline, Food Waste Manager gains the following advantages:
- Automation: Reduces manual interventions and human error.
- Consistent Quality: Ensures every code change is tested and verified.
- Faster Updates: Speeds up delivery of new features and fixes.
- Scalability: Supports growth in both features and users.
- Developer Productivity: Frees developers from repetitive tasks, allowing focus on innovation.
