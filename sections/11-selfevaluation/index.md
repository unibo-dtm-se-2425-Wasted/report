# Self-evaluation

## Viola Morgia

I primarily worked on coding the application and contributed to the report sections that we divided among the team. I also collaborated with my colleagues to ensure consistency and completeness throughout the project.

### Strengths
I am very satisfied with the work I contributed and with the collaboration within the team. The code is functional, well-structured, and supports the features described in the report. The division of tasks in the report allowed for an efficient workflow and clear documentation.

### Weaknesses
The product has some limitations. It is currently based on SQLite, so there is no separate database for each user. Additionally, there are few customization options for visualization and layout, such as sorting or filtering foods for recipes. While many improvements are possible (as described in the “Future Improvements” section), the current version already addresses the initial problem more than sufficiently.

### Overall Evaluation
Despite its limitations, I am very pleased with this initial version. It effectively meets the project goals and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.

My main contribution was writing and organizing the report, making sure it was clear and consistent. I also joined the meetings and brainstorming sessions, where I shared ideas and discussed solutions with the team. In addition, I helped by revising the code written by my colleagues to keep it in line with the report.

The project itself is strong because it already solves the main problem in a simple and working way: users can store and track the expiration date of their food. The main features are implemented, and the application can be a good base for future improvements.
The teamwork was effective, and the way we divided the tasks among the team members worked really well.

The project still has some areas of improvement. For example, it is currently based on a single SQLite database. In the future, the database could be made shareable among multiple users at the same time, so that housemates living together can manage and track their food collectively.

### Strengths of the Product

I genuinely love the idea behind our application. Wasted tackles a real social and environmental issue by helping people reduce food waste, while also improving their personal planning and saving money. The integration of recipes, expiration reminders, and categorization makes the app both practical and user-friendly. One of the strongest aspects is the simplicity and clarity of the interface, which makes it easy for users to quickly input items and monitor their status. Another strength is the collaborative effort of the team: every member brought improvements that made the app more complete than the initial raw version.

### Weaknesses of the Product

Although the product has strong potential, there are still several limitations. The biggest weakness is the way we currently manage the database: all users share the same local database file. This means the app cannot yet distinguish between different users, which creates issues for personalization and scalability. Additionally, while the recipe API adds variety, some results are inconsistent (e.g., recipe images do not always match the dish), which reduces the overall user experience. Finally, we still lack more advanced features such as push notifications, multi-language support, or external integrations, which would make the product more engaging and useful.

### My Role in the Project

My role in the team was to sketch and visualize how the app should look. I started by delivering a raw version of the app, which served as the foundation for the rest of the development. Later, I collaborated with the team to refine the design, improve the user experience, and make the app more functional. Throughout the project, I faced challenges with technical aspects such as managing file paths, linking between the different platforms we used, creating the database structure, and storing data correctly. These struggles slowed me down at times, but they also helped me learn a lot about how to handle databases and how to better structure an application.
