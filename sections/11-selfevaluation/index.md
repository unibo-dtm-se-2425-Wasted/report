# Self-evaluation

- An individual section is required for each member of the group
- Each member must self-evaluate their work, listing the strengths and weaknesses of the product
- Each member must describe their role within the group as objectively as possible
    + Each student is only responsible for their own section

# Self-evaluation

## Viola Morgia

### Role in the Group
I primarily worked on coding the application and contributed to the report sections that we divided among the team. I also collaborated with my colleagues to ensure consistency and completeness throughout the project.

### Strengths
I am very satisfied with the work I contributed and with the collaboration within the team. The code is functional, well-structured, and supports the features described in the report. The division of tasks in the report allowed for an efficient workflow and clear documentation.

### Weaknesses
The product has some limitations. It is currently based on SQLite, so there is no separate database for each user. Additionally, there are few customization options for visualization and layout, such as sorting or filtering foods for recipes. While many improvements are possible (as described in the “Future Improvements” section), the current version already addresses the initial problem more than sufficiently.

### Overall Evaluation
Despite its limitations, I am very pleased with this initial version. It effectively meets the project goals and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.

My main contribution was writing and organizing the report, making sure it was clear and consistent. I also joined the meetings and brainstorming sessions, where I shared ideas and discussed solutions with the team. In addition, I helped by revising the code written by my colleagues to keep it in line with the report.

The project itself is strong because it already solves the main problem in a simple and working way: users can store and track the expiration date of their food. The main features are implemented, and the application can be a good base for future improvements.
The teamwork was effective, and the way we divided the tasks among the team members worked really well.

The project still has some areas of improvement. For example, it is currently based on a single SQLite database. In the future, the database could be made shareable among multiple users at the same time, so that housemates living together can manage and track their food collectively.
