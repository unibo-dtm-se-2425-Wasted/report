# Self-evaluation

## Viola Morgia

### Role in the Group
I primarily worked on coding the application and contributed to the report sections that we divided among the team. I also collaborated with my colleagues to ensure consistency and completeness throughout the project.

### Strengths
I am very satisfied with the work I contributed and with the collaboration within the team. The code is functional, well-structured, and supports the features described in the report. The division of tasks in the report allowed for an efficient workflow and clear documentation.

### Weaknesses
The product has some limitations. It is currently based on SQLite, so there is no separate database for each user. Additionally, there are few customization options for visualization and layout, such as sorting or filtering foods for recipes. While many improvements are possible (as described in the “Future Improvements” section), the current version already addresses the initial problem more than sufficiently.

### Overall Evaluation
Despite its limitations, I am very pleased with this initial version. It effectively meets the project goals and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
