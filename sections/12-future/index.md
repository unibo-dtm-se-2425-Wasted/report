# Future Improvements

## 1. Current Limitations

The Food Waste Manager application is currently functional as a web application, but several limitations remain:

* **Platform Availability**: The app can only be accessed through a web browser; no dedicated mobile application exists.
* **Notifications**: Users do not receive proactive alerts through email, SMS, or push notifications. They must log in manually to check for expiring items.
* **Authentication**: User login/logout functionality is basic, without password protection, account recovery, or multi-user support.
* **Editing and Deleting**: Although supported, these features are not fully streamlined for efficient user interaction (e.g., inline edits or batch operations).
* **Interface**: The design is primarily optimized for desktop use and lacks mobile responsiveness.

## 2. Known Issues

* **Date Handling**: Errors can still occur if expiration dates are missing or invalid.
* **Recipe API Integration**: At times, images provided do not match the actual recipes, and results may be incomplete when only a few ingredients are supplied.
* **Performance**: The local SQLite database may face scalability issues when handling large datasets.

## 3. Potential Future Developments

### Cross-Platform and Mobile Application

* Development of a dedicated mobile application (Android and iOS) using frameworks such as Flutter or React Native.
* Introduction of mobile push notifications for items nearing expiration.
* Offline functionality with synchronization when the device reconnects to the internet.

### Enhanced Notifications

* Integration of email, SMS, and mobile notifications.
* Calendar synchronization with Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook.
* Intelligent reminders based on food usage patterns, suggesting recipes aligned with ingredients that are about to expire.

### Improved User Experience

* Implementation of barcode or QR code scanning for automatic food entry.
* A mobile-first interface design including accessibility features and dark mode.
* Verification and curation of recipe images to ensure accuracy.

### Data and Insights

* Dashboards providing analytics on food consumption, cost savings, and estimated environmental impact (e.g., COâ‚‚ reduction).
* Options for users to export their data to CSV or Excel for further analysis.

### Community and Integrations

* Integration with services such as Too Good To Go and local food donation networks.
* A community feature enabling users to share recipes and ideas for using items near expiration.
* Gamification strategies to encourage continued use and reduce food waste.

### Scalability and Technical Enhancements

* Migration from SQLite to a cloud-hosted database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Firebase, Supabase).
* Multi-user support for households and shared living environments.
* Potential integration with smart kitchen devices or IoT-enabled appliances.
