# Future Improvements

## 1. Current Limitations

There are a few areas where the app could be improved. For instance, notifications and reminders are currently limited to the interface, so users do not receive proactive alerts via email, push notifications, or SMS. User authentication is also basic: the app only supports simple username login, and there is no password protection or account management. Additionally, while users can add food items, editing and deleting entries is still somewhat limited. Finally, the app’s design is primarily desktop-focused and not fully optimized for mobile devices.

## 2. Known Issues

Some features do not always work as intended. Date handling can sometimes produce errors when expiration dates are invalid or missing. Recipe API integration generally works well, but occasionally the images provided do not match the recipe content, which can be confusing. In some cases, if too few ingredients are provided or the API limit is reached, recipe suggestions can be incomplete or irrelevant.

## 3. Potential Future Developments

Looking ahead, several enhancements could make the app more useful and enjoyable:

### Enhanced Notifications

Future versions could include push and mobile notifications for items nearing expiration, possibly integrated with calendar apps like Google Calendar or Outlook. AI-powered reminders could suggest ways to use ingredients before they spoil, such as recommending a pasta dish if tomatoes and cheese are about to expire.

### Improved User Experience (UX)

Automatic food entry via barcode scanning would save users time and reduce errors. The interface could be modernized with a mobile-first design, dark mode, and accessibility features. Recipe images could be verified or curated to ensure they match the actual dishes.

### Data and Insights

Users could receive analytics on their food consumption, including estimated money and CO₂ savings from prevented waste. Trends could be tracked over time, and reports could be exported in CSV or Excel for deeper analysis.

### Community and Integrations

The app could integrate with platforms like Too Good To Go or local donation services to help manage surplus food. A community feature could allow users to share recipes and photos using items that are about to expire.

### Scalability

To support more complex use cases, the app could migrate from SQLite to a cloud-hosted database, enable multi-user support for families or roommates, and even integrate with smart kitchen devices or IoT-enabled appliances.
